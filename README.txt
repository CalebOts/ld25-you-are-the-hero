You are the Hero

Ludum Dare 25 entry

Disclamer: Due to the 48 hour time limit I didn't manage to completley finish
the game. Especially, there was no time to polish the game, or create any
sound at all. Still, it was a good experience to make a game in such a short
timeframe. (And it also made me actually 'finish' something.)

The sole dependency of the game would be python 2.6 or newer (but not 3)
The game should work on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X

You can run the game with 'main.py'.

$ python2 main.py

Controls are W,A,S,D or arrow keys and SPACE.
